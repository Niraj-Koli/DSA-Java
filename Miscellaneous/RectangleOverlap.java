/*
 * An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where
 * (x1, y1) is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) is the
 * coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to
 * the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.
 * 
 * Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be
 * clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.
 * 
 * Given two axis-aligned rectangles rec1 and rec2, return true if they overlap,
 * otherwise return false.
