/*
 * A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a
 * sequence or linear order.
 * 
 * For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of
 * arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
 * The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically
 * greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of
 * the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical
 * order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that
 * follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the
 * array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in
 * ascending order).
 * 
 * For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
 * Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
 * While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does
 * not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
 * Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.
 * 
 * The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.
